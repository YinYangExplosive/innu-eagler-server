# Eaglercraft Survival on Render

This project provides a base for hosting an **Eaglercraft survival server** on a Render web service, using Paper 1.12.2, EaglerXServer, and LoginSecurity. The repository includes free and paid **Blueprint** variants, with `render.yaml` as the primary free configuration.

> **Important:** Nickname authentication is provided by the LoginSecurity plugin through in-game chat commands. On the first visit, a player uses `/register <password>`; on later visits, the player uses `/login <password>`. The system does not use a Mojang password and does not store passwords in plain text.

## How the project works

Render runs the Docker container based on `itzg/minecraft-server:java17`. The free Blueprints install only the pinned EaglerXServer and LoginSecurity releases to reduce memory usage. The paid Blueprint additionally installs ViaVersion, ViaBackwards, and ViaRewind for broader EaglercraftX 1.8 protocol compatibility. Paper acts as the survival server, while EaglerXServer injects Eaglercraft WebSocket support into the same Bukkit/Paper server listener.

Render terminates TLS at the public endpoint and forwards the WebSocket connection to the container. The `scripts/render-start.sh` script reads Render's automatic `PORT` variable and exports it as `SERVER_PORT` before starting the container entrypoint. This keeps the Paper and EaglerXServer ports aligned with the port selected by Render without using unsupported interpolation in `render.yaml`.

LoginSecurity accounts, configuration files, the world, inventories, and other server data are stored under `/data`. The free Blueprints intentionally do not declare a persistent disk, while the paid Blueprint declares a 10 GB disk mounted at `/data`.

## Repository structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `render.yaml` | Primary free Blueprint that creates the Docker web service without a persistent disk. |
| `render-free.yaml` | Additional free Blueprint using the `eaglercraft-survival-free` service name. |
| `render-paid.yaml` | Paid Standard Blueprint with 2 GB RAM, a 10 GB persistent disk, and the full compatibility plugin set. |
| `Dockerfile` | Uses the itzg container and installs the project's startup script. |
| `scripts/render-start.sh` | Converts Render's `PORT` into Minecraft's `SERVER_PORT`. |
| `config/server.properties` | Initial survival-world settings. |
| `config/plugins/EaglercraftXServer/` | TOML configuration for the Eaglercraft listener and server. |
| `config/plugins/LoginSecurity/` | Directory reserved for persistent LoginSecurity configuration. |
| `docs/` | Operations, diagnostics, and plugin hash notes. |
| `docs/plugin-checksums.txt` | URLs and SHA-256 hashes for the pinned JAR files. |

## Deploying with the Render Blueprint

First, create a GitHub repository and push all project files to the `main` branch. In the Render dashboard, choose **New → Blueprint**, connect the repository, and select the desired Blueprint Path: `render.yaml` or `render-free.yaml` for the free version, or `render-paid.yaml` for the paid version.

The free plan is intended for temporary testing. It may suspend the service after 15 minutes without inbound traffic, causing the next connection to take approximately one minute while the process starts again. The world, accounts, plugins, and generated configuration can be lost after suspension, restart, or redeploy. If you later need persistence, change the service to a paid plan and add a persistent disk mounted at `/data`.

After the first deployment, copy the HTTPS address shown by Render. In a compatible EaglercraftX client, add the server using the service address, normally `wss://YOUR-SERVICE-NAME.onrender.com`, without adding a public port. Render web services accept inbound WebSocket connections; if a particular client asks for an HTTP address, use the same hostname with `https://` for queries and the WebSocket address format required by that client version.

## Free mode

Use `render.yaml` or `render-free.yaml` for the free configuration. Both use the `free` plan, do not declare a persistent disk, and create the service `eaglercraft-survival-free`. The free variant installs only EaglerXServer and LoginSecurity, which reduces memory usage but does not include the Via protocol translation plugins.

The free Blueprints currently use an experimental reduced Java profile with a 256 MB maximum heap, a 128 MB initial heap, a 96 MB Metaspace cap, a 48 MB direct-memory cap, a 12 MB code-cache cap, SerialGC, one active processor, and `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1` so the process has room under Render's 512 MB instance limit. This profile is intended only to test whether Paper 1.12.2 can complete its first startup on the free instance; it is not guaranteed to work and is not suitable for a persistent public survival server. Render may suspend a free web service after 15 minutes without inbound traffic, and local filesystem changes can be lost after suspension, restart, or redeploy. That means the world, accounts, plugins, and generated configuration may disappear.

## Paid mode

Use `render-paid.yaml` when you need the full compatibility set. It creates the `eaglercraft-survival-paid` service on the Standard plan, allocates 2 GB of RAM, installs ViaVersion, ViaBackwards, and ViaRewind, and attaches a 10 GB persistent disk at `/data`. The paid variant is the recommended configuration for a permanent server and for clients that require protocol translation.

## Player authentication flow

On the first visit, the nickname selected by the player does not yet exist on the server. LoginSecurity blocks access to the world and tells the player in chat to run `/register <password>`. After registration, the player can enter the survival world. On a later visit with the same nickname, the plugin blocks access until the player runs `/login <password>`.

The password should be different from the player's personal passwords and must not be shared. To change a password, use `/changepassword <current-password> <new-password>`. To end the current session, use `/logout`. Administrators can consult the LoginSecurity documentation for administrative commands and account recovery.

| Situation | Command |
| --- | --- |
| First-time registration | `/register <password>` |
| Sign in to an existing account | `/login <password>` |
| Change a password | `/changepassword <current-password> <new-password>` |
| End the current session | `/logout` |
| Remove your own account | `/unregister <current-password>` |

## Survival configuration

The initial values use survival mode, normal difficulty, enabled PVP, a maximum of 20 players, a reduced view distance, and disabled spawn protection. These choices reduce resource and bandwidth usage for a small server. They can be changed through the corresponding variables in the selected Blueprint or through `server.properties` after the first boot.

EaglerXServer is configured with WebSocket compression, a dual-stack listener, and original-IP forwarding through the `X-Forwarded-For` header. TLS is not enabled inside the plugin because public TLS is terminated by Render before the connection reaches the container. EaglerXServer voice service remains disabled by default.

## Local Docker test

To test the project before deployment, install Docker and run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t eaglercraft-survival .
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=PAPER \
  -e VERSION=1.12.2 \
  -e PAPER_BUILD=1620 \
  -e MEMORY=224M \
  -e INIT_MEMORY=96M \
  -e MAX_MEMORY=224M \
  -e USE_AIKAR_FLAGS=false \
  -e SERVER_PORT=25565 \
  -e PORT=25565 \
  -v "$PWD/local-data:/data" \
  eaglercraft-survival
```

When the console reports that the server has finished starting, connect a local Java client to `localhost:25565` or use an Eaglercraft client that supports WebSocket connections at `ws://localhost:25565`. The first run may take longer because the container downloads Paper and the selected plugins. Do not place passwords, worlds, or private logs in GitHub.

## Security and maintenance

Plugin URLs are pinned to specific releases to reduce unexpected changes during deployment. The paid Blueprint uses ViaVersion, ViaBackwards, and ViaRewind to provide the protocol translation recommended for EaglercraftX 1.8 clients connecting to the Paper 1.12.2 server. When updating a version, change the URL in the selected Blueprint, read the upstream release notes, and back up the server data before synchronizing the Blueprint. The server uses `online-mode=false` because Eaglercraft clients do not perform Mojang premium authentication; therefore, LoginSecurity is essential to prevent another person from using the same nickname.

The free Blueprints do not include a persistent disk. The paid Blueprint includes a 10 GB disk, but a persistent disk is not a complete backup. Make regular copies of `/data`, especially before updates, version changes, or additional plugin installations. Never publish tokens, passwords, database files, private `server.properties` data, or credentials for external services.

## Known limitations

This project is a simple base for a small survival server. The free variant deliberately uses a low-memory Java profile and only the essential plugins, so it should be limited to a small number of players. The paid variant is better suited to protocol compatibility, persistence, and a continuously running survival server. Render may restart instances, interrupt WebSocket connections during maintenance or deployments, and apply CPU, memory, and traffic limits according to the selected plan.

LoginSecurity provides chat-based registration and login, not a graphical password screen in the Eaglercraft menu. If you need a custom graphical interface or external-database integration, you will need to develop a separate Bukkit plugin and review the authentication flow.
